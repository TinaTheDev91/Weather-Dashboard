# Weather-Dashboard
Weather dashboard using server-side API's

## Description

This application was created as both a useful tool for checking the weather around the world, as well as a way of demonstrating how API's can be used when developing applications. Through the coding process, I learned how to read the data provided by the API via the console log, as well as navigate to my desired information and place it on my webpage. The biggest challenge through this process was correcting and dubugging errors, as well as correcting layout and data placement that was effected by coding my JavaScript file.
